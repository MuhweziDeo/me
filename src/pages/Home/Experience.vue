                        Iam currently working on<a href="https://lendborrowbuy.com/">LendBorrowBuy</a>
                        which is is an online open community rental marketplace where you can lend, borrow and buy! Simply put, we are connecting people who have, with those that don’t. In other words, we created a “shareconomy” platform that everyone can benefit from. Our focus is to help everyone become micro-entrepreneurs by turning their everyday, under-utilized items
                         or “assets” into profit generating resources. This is how you “make your assets work for you!”
